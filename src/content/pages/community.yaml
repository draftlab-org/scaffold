      ## Our Community

      We are a growing network of people who believe technology should serve
      the public interest. Whether you're a privacy researcher, a civic
      technologist, a policy advocate, or someone who cares about how
      technology shapes our communities — there's a place for you here.

      We believe in:

      - **Open collaboration** — Working in the open, sharing knowledge freely
      - **Privacy by design** — Building consent and transparency into everything we make
      - **Community self-determination** — Technology should strengthen communities, not extract from them
