      ## Hero Sections

      **Props:** `title` (required), `subtitle`, `backgroundImage`

  - type: hero
    title: Privacy is a Human Right

      ## Rich Text Sections

      The `richText` section renders markdown content with full formatting support. It supports background colors, the highlight background type, and an optional table of contents sidebar for long-form content.

      **Props:** `content` (required), `withTOC`, `background.bgColor`, `background.bgType`

  - type: richText
    content: |-
      ### Plain Rich Text

      This section demonstrates standard markdown formatting. Rich text sections are the backbone of content pages — they render any valid markdown with full support for inline formatting, lists, links, and images.

      Here is **bold text**, *italic text*, and `inline code`. You can also use [links](https://example.org) and create structured content:

      - Unordered list item one
      - Unordered list item two
      - Nested items work too
        - Like this sub-item

      1. Ordered lists are also supported
      2. With automatic numbering
      3. And proper indentation

      > Blockquotes can highlight important ideas. Privacy by design means building consent and transparency into the architecture itself, not bolting it on as an afterthought.

      ---

      Horizontal rules separate content visually, and images can be embedded inline:

  - type: richText
    withTOC: true
    content: |-
      ## Table of Contents Example

      When `withTOC: true` is set, a sidebar navigation appears on desktop showing all headings. This is useful for long-form documentation, policy pages, or research reports.

      ### Digital Rights Framework

      A digital rights framework establishes the principles and standards that protect people's fundamental freedoms in digital spaces. It encompasses everything from data protection to algorithmic transparency.

      ### Privacy by Design

      Privacy by design is an approach to systems engineering that takes privacy into account throughout the whole engineering process. The concept is an example of value-sensitive design, which takes human values into account in a well-defined manner throughout the process.

      ### Open Source Governance

      Open source governance models define how decisions are made in open source projects. From benevolent dictator models to consensus-based democratic processes, governance shapes the long-term sustainability of community-driven software.

      ### Data Sovereignty

      Data sovereignty refers to the idea that data is subject to the laws and governance structures within the jurisdiction it is collected. For communities and nations, this means maintaining control over data about their people and processes.

      ### Algorithmic Accountability

      As automated decision-making systems increasingly affect people's lives, algorithmic accountability ensures these systems can be examined, questioned, and corrected when they produce harmful outcomes.

      ### Digital Accessibility

      Accessibility in digital spaces means designing technology that works for everyone, regardless of ability. This includes screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation, color contrast, and cognitive load considerations.

      ### Community-Centered Design

      Community-centered design shifts the focus from individual users to the communities they belong to. It asks not just "does this work for a person?" but "does this strengthen the community's capacity for self-determination?"

      bgColor: gradient
      bgType: full
    content: |-
      ### Gradient Background

      Rich text sections can use a gradient background by setting `bgColor: gradient`. This creates a subtle blue-to-indigo gradient that works well for callouts or featured content blocks.

      This variation is useful for drawing attention to key messages without using a full hero section.

  - type: richText
    background:
      bgType: highlight
    content: |-
      ### Highlight Background

      Setting `bgType: highlight` renders the decorative highlight SVG as an absolute-positioned background. This creates a distinctive, branded visual treatment for special content sections.

      The `button` section displays a row of call-to-action buttons. Each button has a `variant` (primary, secondary, outline, ghost) and a `size` (sm, md, lg).

      **Props:** `title`, `buttons[]` with `variant`, `size`, `href`, `text`

      ## Card Sections

      The `card` section displays a grid of cards with optional images, content, and per-card buttons. Cards support a `color` prop (primary, secondary, highlight, neutral) that changes their visual treatment. Section-level buttons appear below the grid.

          ### Why Digital Rights Matter

          The tools we build shape the freedoms people can exercise. When technology is designed without regard for human rights, it becomes a mechanism of control rather than empowerment.

          Every design decision is a values decision. Choosing end-to-end encryption is choosing privacy. Choosing open protocols is choosing interoperability. Choosing accessible interfaces is choosing inclusion.

            content: Collect only the data you need. Retain it only as long as necessary. Delete it when done.
