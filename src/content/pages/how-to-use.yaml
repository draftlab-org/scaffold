      Scaffold is a website starter built with [Astro](https://astro.build). It
      gives you a ready-to-use site with a page builder, a content management
      system, and a set of reusable components.


      This guide walks you through installation, day-to-day editing, and the
      main concepts you need to know.

      ## Getting started


      ### Prerequisites


      You'll need **Git**, **Node.js** (v20 or later), and a **GitHub** account.
      A basic familiarity with the command line is helpful but not required
      beyond the steps listed here.


      ### Installation


      Clone the repository and install dependencies:


      ```bash

      npx create-astro --template draftlab-org/scaffold

      cd your-project-name

      npm install

      ```


      ### Running the development server


      ```bash

      npm run dev

      ```


      This starts a local server, usually at `http://localhost:4321`. Changes
      you make to files will appear in the browser almost instantly.


      ### Building for production


      ```bash

      npm run build

      ```


      This generates a fully static site in the `dist/` folder. You can preview
      the production build locally with:


      ```bash

      npm run preview

      ```


      ### Deploying


      Scaffold is pre-configured for **Netlify**. Connect your GitHub repository
      to a Netlify site and every push to `main` will trigger a new build. No
      additional configuration is needed — the `netlify.toml` and Astro adapter
      are already set up.


      You can also deploy to any platform that supports static sites (Vercel,
      Cloudflare Pages, GitHub Pages, etc.) by swapping the Astro adapter in
      `astro.config.mjs`.


      ## How the site works


      ### Pages and sections


      Every page on the site is defined by a YAML file in `src/content/pages/`.
      A page file looks something like this:


      ```yaml

      title: About Us

      status: published

      permalink: about

      sections:
        - type: hero
          title: About Our Organization
          subtitle: Building technology for the public good.
        - type: richText
          content: |
            We are a small team of designers and engineers...
        - type: people
          category: Leadership
      ```


      The `sections` array is the core of the page builder. Each section has a
      `type` that determines which component renders it. Sections are rendered
      in order, top to bottom.


      ### Available section types


      | Type | What it does |

      | --- | --- |

      | **hero** | Full-width banner with title, optional subtitle, and optional
      background image |

      | **richText** | Markdown content — supports headings, lists, links,
      images, code blocks, tables. Optional table of contents sidebar |

      | **button** | A row of call-to-action buttons with configurable variants
      and sizes |

      | **card** | A grid of content cards, each with optional image, markdown
      text, and button |

      | **people** | A grid of team member profiles pulled from the People
      collection. Filterable by category |

      | **partners** | A grid of partner logos pulled from the Partners
      collection. Filterable by category |

      | **articlesRoll** | A feed of recent articles, with optional category
      filter and limit |

      | **featuredPartners** | A curated row of partner logos, selected by ID or
      shown by featured flag |

      | **resourcesRoll** | A feed of recent resources (reports, guides, case
      studies) |

      | **flexi** | A container for nesting other sections (richText, button,
      card) inside a single block |


      Every section can also set a `background` with `bgColor` (white, gray, or
      gradient) to create visual rhythm on the page.


      ### Content collections


      Beyond pages, the site manages several types of content:


      *   **Articles** (`src/content/articles/`) — Markdown blog posts with
      frontmatter for title, excerpt, authors, tags, and hero image.
          
      *   **People** (`src/content/people/`) — Team member profiles with name,
      title, headshot, affiliation, and category tags.
          
      *   **Partners** (`src/content/partners/`) — Organizations with logo, URL,
      category, and display order.
          
      *   **Resources** (`src/content/resources/`) — Publications like reports,
      whitepapers, and guides with external download links.
          
      *   **Navigation** (`src/content/navigation/`) — Menu definitions for the
      header and footer. Supports single links and dropdown menus.
          
      *   **Site Settings** (`src/content/site/config.json`) — Global
      configuration: site title, description, social links, favicon, Open Graph
      image, cookie consent, and footer text.
          

      Each collection has a schema defined in `src/content/config.ts`. Astro
      validates every file against its schema at build time, so you'll get a
      clear error message if something is missing or malformed.


      ### Content status


      All content supports a `status` field with three values:


      *   **draft** — Only visible when running the development server.
          
      *   **published** — Visible everywhere.
          
      *   **archived** — Still visible, but can be styled differently or
      filtered out.
          

      This lets you work on new content without publishing it, and retire old
      content without deleting it.


      ## Using PagesCMS


      ### What is PagesCMS?


      [PagesCMS](https://pagescms.org) is a free, open-source content management
      system that works directly with your GitHub repository. It gives you a
      visual interface for editing content — no need to open YAML or JSON files
      by hand.


      When you save changes in PagesCMS, it commits them directly to your
      repository, which triggers a new build and deploy.


      ### Setting it up


      1.  Go to [app.pagescms.org](https://app.pagescms.org) and sign in with
      your GitHub account.
          
      2.  Select the repository where your Scaffold site lives.
          
      3.  PagesCMS reads the `.pages.yml` file in the root of the repository and
      automatically sets up the editing interface.
          

      That's it. No API keys, no database, no separate hosting.


      ### What you can do in PagesCMS


      *   **Edit pages** — Add, remove, and reorder sections. Each section type
      has a form with the relevant fields.
          
      *   **Write articles** — Use the built-in Markdown editor with live
      preview.
          
      *   **Manage people** — Add team members with headshots and roles.
          
      *   **Manage partners** — Upload partner logos, set display order, and
      toggle featured status.
          
      *   **Manage resources** — Add publications with download links and
      contributor cross-references.
          
      *   **Edit navigation** — Change header and footer menus, add dropdown
      menus, link to internal pages or external URLs.
          
      *   **Update site settings** — Change the site title, description, social
      links, analytics ID, and cookie consent copy.
          
      *   **Upload images** — All images are stored in `src/assets/` and
      automatically optimized at build time.
          

      ### How images work


      When you upload an image through PagesCMS, it gets committed to
      `src/assets/` in your repository. At build time, Astro optimizes these
      images — resizing, converting to modern formats, and generating responsive
      `srcset` attributes.


      Image paths in content files always start with `/src/assets/`. For
      example: `/src/assets/team/headshot.jpg`.


      ## For developers


      ### Project structure


      ```

      src/

      ├── assets/          Images and media

      ├── components/

      │   ├── atoms/       Basic elements (Button, Link, Image)

      │   ├── molecules/   Combinations (Card, NavItem)

      │   ├── organisms/   Complex components (Navigation, Footer)

      │   └── sections/    Page section components

      ├── content/         Content collections (YAML, JSON, Markdown)

      ├── layouts/         Page layouts

      ├── pages/           File-based routing

      ├── styles/          Tailwind theme and global CSS

      └── utils/           Utility functions

      ```


      Components follow **atomic design** — atoms are the smallest building
      blocks, molecules combine atoms, organisms combine molecules, and sections
      are full-width page blocks.


      ### Adding a new page


      Create a new YAML file in `src/content/pages/`. The filename becomes the
      URL path (e.g., `privacy-policy.yaml` → `/privacy-policy`). A GitHub
      Action keeps filenames and `permalink` fields in sync automatically.


      ### Customizing styles


      Scaffold uses Tailwind CSS v4 with custom theme tokens defined in
      `src/styles/`:


      *   `colors.css` — Color palette (primary, secondary, highlight, gray)
          
      *   `typography.css` — Font families, prose styling, heading scales
          
      *   `breakpoints.css` — Responsive breakpoints
          

      Change the color palette in `colors.css` and the entire site updates.


      ### API endpoints


      Every content collection is automatically exposed as a JSON API:


      *   `/api/pages.json`
          
      *   `/api/articles.json`
          
      *   `/api/people.json`
          
      *   `/api/partners.json`
          
      *   `/api/resources.json`
          

      These are generated at build time and can be used by external tools or
      client-side JavaScript.
